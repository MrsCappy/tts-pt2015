Write a method called “going_hiking” that takes one variable, temp, and will return “Let’s go hiking!” if temp >= 50.  Add another if statement so that the method returns “That’s WAY too cold for hiking!” if temp is below 50
Add another if statement that will return the string, “It is 23 degrees!” when our variable temp is exactly 23.  Have the program ask the user what the temperature is, and return whether that temperature is appropriate for hiking.

#def going_hiking
  temperature = 58
      if temperature <= 59
      puts "Make some chicken noodle soup and stay in!"
  end
      if temperature >=60
    puts "Let's go hiking! NOW!"
  end  


bottles = 50

while bottles != 0
  bottles = bottles - 1
  puts "#{bottles} How many bottle of beer on the wall!"
end
