1) Create a method that converts weight from pounds to kilograms.

my_name = 'John Smith'

height_inches = 60

weight_pounds = 120

height_centimeters = height_inches * 2.54

weight_kilograms = weight_pounds * 0.453592

puts my_name.chomp + ' is ' + height_centimeters.to_s + ' cm and ' + weight_kilograms.to_s + ' kg.'
=end

=begin
2) Write a program that takes a string argument and outputs the string in reverse.
done in irb

name = "parttime rocks!"; name.reverse!
=end

=begin
3) Write a program that prompts you for a string then outputs the length of the string.

 
$ ruby string_length.rb

Enter a string: Four score and seven years

Your string is 26 characters long.
in irb

"parttime rocks!".length
=end

=begin
4) When dividing numbers in Ruby, what if we want to include the remainder as well? Write a program that asks for two integers, divides the first by the second and returns the result including the remainder. If either of the numbers is not an integer, then donâ€™t accept the number and ask again. Do not accept zero (0) as a number. The output should be similar to this:

 
$ ruby divider.rb

Enter an Integer: 6

Enter an Integer: 4

You said to calculate: 6 / 4

The answer is 1 with a remainder of 2
in irb

result = 6.0/4.0; result.to_f  
1.5
